The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create families of related
or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. 
This pattern is particularly useful when the system needs to be independent
of how its objects are created or when you want to ensure that a family of related objects are used together.

Key components:
- Abstract Factory: Declares a set of methods for creating abstract products.
- Concrete Factory: Implements the creation methods for specific product variants.
- Abstract Product: Declares the interface for a type of product object.
- Concrete Product: Implements the abstract product interface for a specific variant.
- Client: Works with the abstract factory and abstract product interfaces, 
remaining independent of the concrete implementations.

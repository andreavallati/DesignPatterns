The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating
objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. 
It's useful when the exact type of object isn't known until runtime or when you want to 
centralize the creation logic for objects of a particular type.

In C#, the Factory Method pattern can be implemented by creating an abstract base
class with a method that returns an object, and then having subclasses override that
method to provide specific implementations.

Key Components:
- Product: Defines the interface for the type of object to be created.
- Concrete Product: Implements the Product interface.
- Creator: Declares the factory method, which returns an object of type Product. 
The Creator can either be an abstract class or an interface.
- Concrete Creator: Implements the factory method to return a Concrete Product.

Steps to implement:
- Define the Product interface or abstract class.
- Create Concrete Products that implement the Product interface.
- Create a Creator class with the factory method.
- Create Concrete Creators that override the factory method to instantiate specific Concrete Products.

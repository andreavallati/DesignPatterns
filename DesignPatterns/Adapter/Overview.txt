The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. 
It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by "adapting" one interface to another.
In C#, this is particularly useful when you need to integrate a class that has an interface which 
differs from what your code expects.

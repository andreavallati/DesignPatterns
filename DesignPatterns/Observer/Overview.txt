The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object (the subject) maintains a list of
dependents (called observers) and notifies them automatically of any state changes, 
usually by calling one of their methods. The observers subscribe to the subject, 
and when the subject's state changes, all subscribed observers are notified. 
This pattern is often used to implement distributed event-handling systems.

Steps to Implement the Observer Pattern in C#:
- Subject Interface: The subject interface declares methods for adding, removing, and notifying observers.
- Observer Interface: The observer interface defines a method for receiving updates.
- Concrete Subject: Implements the subject interface, holds the state, and notifies observers of changes.
- Concrete Observer: Implements the observer interface and defines the response to updates.

The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern used to construct complex objects step by step. 
It helps to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, 
allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

In C#, the Builder Pattern is particularly useful when the object construction involves multiple steps,
and you want to control this process in a readable and maintainable way.

When to use the Builder Pattern:
- When an object is complex (having many fields) and requires multiple configurations or 
steps during initialization.
- When you want the object to be immutable after construction.
- When creating different representations of an object using the same construction process.

Key components of the Builder Pattern:
- Product: The complex object to be built.
- Builder: Specifies an abstract interface for building parts of the Product.
- Concrete Builder: Implements the steps defined by the Builder to create the Product.
- Director: Controls the building process (optional, based on specific requirements).

Steps to Implement:
- Create the Product class (the object to be built).
- Define an abstract or interface Builder class.
- Implement the Concrete Builder class for the actual construction logic.
- Use a Director class (optional) to manage the order of building steps.
